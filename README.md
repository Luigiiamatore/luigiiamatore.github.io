# Luigi Amatore - Personal Website 💻
Welcome to my personal repository! This site serves as my digital business card and portfolio, hosted at [gigiamatore.me](https://gigiamatore.me).

## 🛠️ Tech stack
* **Frontend**: HTML5 & Trailwind CSS
* **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
* **Domain Management**: Squarespace

## 🚀 How it works
This site is a static web application. Every time a `push` is made to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers a new deployment to the custom domain.
